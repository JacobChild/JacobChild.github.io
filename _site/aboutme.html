<p><strong>Introduction</strong> <br />
Hello Friends! 你好 (Ni Hao)！Apa Khabar kawan! <br />
This is my statically hosted github pages website made with Jekyll.</p>

<p>There are a few tests on this page:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Does formatting stick? The number 1 should be tabbed in, and there should be a line break after “kawan!” and “Jekyll.”</li>
  <li>Below these paragraphs does it tell you what page you are on and is it correct?</li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks for visiting! Love ya!</p>

<p>Here is what I learned: <br />
If in the .md file there is an empty line between paragraphs it does the same when rendered. If I just do “enter” or “/n” it doesn’t work, in that case you must use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;br&gt;</code>.<br /></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Tabbing can be done with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&gt; </code> making sure there is a space after. It also happens naturally in an itemized list, as is shown with my 1 and 2.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thanks for visiting! Love ya!</p>

<p><strong>Ps:</strong> It looks like I forgot the actual <em>“About Me”</em> stuff haha! My name is Jacob Child. I am a senior Mechanical Engineering student at Brigham Young University with huge desire to use engineering to change the world for good. I love people and I love sunsets and I love smiling, and most of all I love Jesus!</p>
